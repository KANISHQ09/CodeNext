CodeNext — HackerRank Clone
🔗 Live Demo

📌 Project Overview
CodeNext is a front-end clone of the popular coding platform HackerRank, built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout and feel of a modern coding challenge website, complete with a clean UI, code editor section, and responsive design.

This project helped me explore how to structure complex layouts, handle responsive behavior, and simulate real-world platforms for learning and portfolio-building purposes.
